To identify the backrest of the armchair in the scene:

1. From the scene graph, <span class="text-green">**object-2 is described as "A glossy leather armchair with a rich brown color... Features padded armrests, a cushioned seat, and a slightly reclined backrest."**</span>
2. <span class="text-green">**In the 2D images (frames 4, 5, 6, 7), object-2 is clearly identified as an armchair.**</span>
3. The 3D bounding box for object-2 is:
    - Position: [-0.4, 1.58, 0.38]
    - Size: [0.89, 0.82, 0.75] (xlength, ylength, zlength)
4. The backrest of an armchair is typically the rear upper section. Given the box dimensions, the backrest is most likely the <span class="text-green">**upper third of the armchair's bounding box, along the z-axis.**</span>

**Calculating Backrest Bounding Box:**

- The z-size for object-2 is 0.75m, and the box center z is 0.38m.
- Assuming the backrest occupies the rear <span class="text-red">**1/3 of the armchair's depth (x-axis)**</span> and the upper 1/3 of the height (z-axis):
    - x-size: 0.89 / 3 ≈ 0.30m (rear third)
    - y-size: remain unchanged: 0.82m
    - z-size: 0.75 / 3 ≈ 0.25m (top third)
- <span class="text-red">**The armchair is oriented such that the "back" is more negative in the x-direction (usual for such layouts).**</span>
- The center for the backrest along x (rear third):
    - The object-2 x-center is -0.4
    - Shift backward by one third of xlength: -0.4 - (0.89 / 3) ≈ -0.4 - 0.297 ≈ -0.697
    - To get the new backrest center (since it's smaller): place it at the rear edge + half of backrest x-size:
        - Rear edge: -0.4 - (0.89 / 2) = -0.4 - 0.445 = -0.845
        - Center: -0.845 + (0.30 / 2) = -0.845 + 0.15 = -0.695
- y-center is unchanged: 1.58
- z-center (top third):
    - z-object-center is 0.38
    - Top edge: 0.38 + (0.75 / 2) = 0.38 + 0.375 = 0.755
    - Center of top third: 0.755 - (0.25 / 2) = 0.755 - 0.125 = 0.63

### Final predicted bounding box for the backrest of the armchair:

**Center coordinates:** {xcoordinate: -0.695, ycoordinate: 1.58, zcoordinate: 0.63}

**Size:** {xlength: 0.30, ylength: 0.82, zlength: 0.25}
