Let's break down the referring expression:

"Find the cabinet under the TV monitor that is about 0.4 meters away from the green table."

Step 1: Identify the TV monitor.

- From the scenegraph, <span class="text-green">**object-7**</span> is described as "a possibly electronic flat-screen television with a black frame and rectangular shape ... positioned on a stand against the wall in a living room setting, near furniture like a bed and shelves."
    
    Step 2: Identify the green table.
    
- From the scenegraph, **object-8** is "a wooden table with a green and white floral-patterned tablecloth ... positioned in a room setting, surrounded by chairs and other furniture items like a bed and storage units."
    
    Step 3: Locate the cabinet under the TV and near the green table.
    
- From the 2D images and BEV, the TV (object-7) is mounted on the wall. Below it, we see <span class="text-green">**object-3 and object-4 (from the 2D image 4).**</span> Both are immediately beneath the TV.

- The referring expression specifies proximity to the green table (object-8), about 0.4 meters away.
    
    Step 4: Measure the distance:
    
- **object-8 (table):** position [0.08, -1.48, 0.69]
- **object-3:** position [-1.29, 0.63, 0.51]
- **object-4:** position [-1.27, -0.39, 0.55]

<span class="text-red">**Calculate 2D (x, y) distance from object-8 (table) to each candidate:**</span>

- <span class="text-red">**To object-3: √((0.08 + 1.29)² + (-1.48 - 0.63)²) = √(1.37² + (-2.11)²) ≈ √(1.88 + 4.45) ≈ √6.33 ≈ 2.52 meters**</span>
- <span class="text-red">**To object-4: √((0.08 + 1.27)² + (-1.48 + 0.39)²) = √(1.35² + (-1.09)²) ≈ √(1.82 + 1.19) ≈ √3.01 ≈ 1.73 meters**</span>

Using center-to-center

Object-3 and Object-4 are much farther than 0.4 meters. Let's consider the closest other object near the TV wall cabinet and check their precise locations. Is there another possible candidate near the TV cabinet wall, closer to the table?

However, in the 2D images, **object-4** is the small cabinet directly below the TV, and the other storage (object-3) is a bit further. Given object-4 is under the TV, nearest to the table along the path connecting the two features.

Thus:

**object-4** is the intended "cabinet under the TV monitor".
