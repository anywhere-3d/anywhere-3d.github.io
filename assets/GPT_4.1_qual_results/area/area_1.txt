To identify the lounge featuring a black velvet ottoman within a larger blue fabric sofa area, accompanied by couch tables, let's break down the evidence:

**Step 1: Key Components from Referring Expression**

- Black velvet ottoman: visually confirmed as <span class="text-green">**object-15**</span> in the 2D image (last one).
- Large blue fabric sofa area: <span class="text-green">**most likely object-2**</span> (from scene graph: "fabric sofa with light gray coloring... living room setting, near a wooden coffee table and other furniture"), plus the context of many cushions (objects 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 107, 360) indicating a sofa zone in the top area of the BEV.
- Couch tables: <span class="text-green">**object-3**</span> ("wooden possibly tray-type object... serving or holding items... near a sofa") fits, and probably others nearby.

**Step 2: Spatial Context in BEV Image**

- The lounge zone is the upper area in BEV (north part), where many objects cluster: 2, 3, 15, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 107, 360, all surrounding the rug and sofa configuration.
- The black ottoman (object-15) is centrally positioned relative to this grouping.

**Step 3: Bounding Box Calculation**

To encompass the lounge with sofa(s), ottoman, and side tables, we need a box covering:

- X axis: Leftmost is object-2 at about x: -1.01, rightmost is around object-3 (x: -0.69); but cushions/objects like object-14 extend even further left (x: -2.44). However, most lounge <span class="text-green">**cluster is between x: -2.2 to roughly x: 0.**</span>
- Y axis: <span class="text-red">**Northernmost is about y: -4.1 (object-12/108), southernmost relevant to lounge is about y: -2.0 (object-3, object-2). So lounge cluster is around y: -4.1 to -2.0.**</span>
- Z axis: Most furniture maxes at z: 1.8, but the typical sofa/ottoman/cushion zone sits within z: 0 to 1.8.

**Step 4: Aggregate Box**

Let's aggregate it conservatively:

- Take the center to be the middle of the lounge cluster:
    - x: (min: -2.2, max: 0) → mean ≈ -1.1
    - y: (min: -4.1, max: -2.0) → mean ≈ -3.05
    - z: (min: 0, max: 1.8) → mean ≈ 0.9
- The lengths:
    - x: (max - min): 0 - (-2.2) = 2.2
    - y: (-2.0) - (-4.1) = 2.1
    - z: 1.8 (to include top of stacked elements and people/seating level)
