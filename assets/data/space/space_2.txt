To solve this, let's break down the referring expression and use the scene graph and supporting images:

**Referring Expression:**

"Move the washing basket placed near the wardrobe closet 0.95 meters outward to ensure it is entirely on the floor."

**Step 1: Identify the washing basket near the wardrobe closet.**

- The wardrobe closet in the scene graph is likely <span class="text-red">**"object-2" (position: [-1.25, 0.36, 2.1], size: [0.6, 6.59, 4.09])**</span>, as it has the largest vertical size and is described as a wardrobe in images.

<span class="text-red">**It is wall actually**</span>

- We are looking for an object near this, described as a washing basket.
    
    Reviewing objects near (by position) and with clues of being a basket or container:
    
- <span class="text-green">**object-23: position: [-0.83, 2.45, 0.31], size: [0.55, 0.6, 0.52], caption: "...fabric container-type object ... likely used for storage or laundry. Positioned on the floor near a bed with blue bedding and a wardrobe in the background."**</span>
- This matches our target: laundry (washing) basket, near the wardrobe (object-2), on the floor.

**Step 2: Determine the direction for "outward" movement.**

- "Outward" typically means <span class="text-red">**away from the wardrobe closet.**</span>
- Object-23's position: [-0.83, 2.45, 0.31]
- Wardrobe closet position (object-2): [-1.25, 0.36, 2.1]
    
    Compute direction vector from wardrobe to basket (projecting on x and y plane, as z is floor height):
    
    Basket center: (-0.83, 2.45)
    
    Wardrobe center: (-1.25, 0.36)
    
    Direction = (Basket - Wardrobe): (-0.83 - (-1.25), 2.45 - 0.36) = (0.42, 2.09)
    
    Magnitude = sqrt(0.42² + 2.09²) ≈ sqrt(0.1764 + 4.3681) ≈ sqrt(4.5445) ≈ 2.13
    
    <span class="text-red">**Normalized direction = (0.42/2.13, 2.09/2.13) ≈ (0.197, 0.981)**</span>
    

**Step 3: Move the basket 0.95 meters in this direction.**

Δx = 0.95 * 0.197 ≈ 0.19

Δy = 0.95 * 0.981 ≈ 0.93

New position:

x = -0.83 + 0.19 = -0.64

y = 2.45 + 0.93 = 3.38

z = 0.31 (unchanged, since only x and y move on the floor)

**Step 4: The 3D bounding box size remains unchanged.**

object-23 size: [0.55, 0.6, 0.52]

**Final Answer**

1. The x, y, z coordinates of its center, strictly formatted as:
    
    {xcoordinate: -0.64, ycoordinate: 3.38, zcoordinate: 0.31}
    
2. The length of the 3D bounding box along the x, y, and z axes, strictly formatted as:
    
    {xlength: 0.55, ylength: 0.6, zlength: 0.52}
