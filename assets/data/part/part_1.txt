- **Identify "the pink glass vase":**
    - Searching captions for vase-like objects:
        - <span class="text-green">**object-26: "A possibly ceramic vase-type object with purple and white floral patterns..."**</span>
    - This is the only reference to a vase with a potential color match (pink/purple). Therefore, object-26 is the pink glass vase.
- **Identify the cupboard:**
    - <span class="text-green">**object-6: "A light wood possibly container-type object with a natural finish and rectangular shape. Features multiple open shelves..."**
    - object-6 matches a cupboard with compartments.</span>
- **Determine the compartment in which the vase is placed:**
    - object-26 caption: "...Placed on a shelf within a display cabinet, surrounded by other items."
    - The "compartment" is a shelf within object-6.
        
        From the 3D positions:
        
    - object-6 (cupboard): position = [-0.66, -0.04, 2.23], size = [0.42, 0.57, 1.88]
    - object-26 (vase): position = [-0.65, -0.03, 2.77], size = [0.16, 0.22, 0.24]
        
        The vase's center is slightly higher (z=2.77) than the cupboard's center (z=2.23), and the x/y coordinates are almost identical, indicating the vase is on an upper shelf/compartment of the cupboard.
        
        <span class="text-red">**To answer the referring expression, we must return the 3D bounding box of the compartment (shelf) where object-26 is located, which is most likely aligned with the bounding box of object-26 itself as a fine-grained compartment.**</span>
        
        **Final Output:**
        
- Center coordinates: {xcoordinate: -0.65, ycoordinate: -0.03, zcoordinate: 2.77}
- Size: {xlength: 0.16, ylength: 0.22, zlength: 0.24}
